How to integrate vue.js into an existing ASP.Net MVC application (including development integration)

## Motivation

Imaging one has an existing ASP.NET MVC project and wants to add some Vue.js components to it. One would like to keep the sources for the MVC and the Vue.js parts in a single solution and of course get the application updated after some change in the Vue.js components without manual copy of files between the solution folders.

I will show a working solution for a simple straightforward setup (with almost no constraints).
